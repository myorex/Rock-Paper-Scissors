# Rock Paper Scissors (console Version)

A simple Rock–Paper–Scissors game built with HTML, JavaScript, played through a browser-based user interface. This project is an extension of the classic console-based game, refactored to use DOM manipulation and event-driven logic.


 Project Overview

This application allows a human player to play **Rock–Paper–Scissors against the computer** over **five rounds**.
The player selects an option using on-screen buttons, while the computer randomly chooses its move. Scores are tracked and displayed in real time, and a winner is declared at the end of the game.

The project was built to reinforce core JavaScript concepts such as:

* Functions
* Conditional logic
* Event listeners
* DOM manipulation
* State management

## Features

* Button-based user input (Rock, Paper, Scissors)
* Randomized computer choices
* Five-round game logic
* Real-time score tracking
* Final winner announcement
* Clean and minimal user interface

---

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* JavaScript

No external libraries or frameworks were used.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser
3. Click one of the buttons to make your choice
4. Play through all five rounds to see the final result

No additional setup or dependencies are required.

## Game Rules

* Rock beats Scissors
* Scissors beats Paper
* Paper beats Rock
* If both players choose the same option, the round is a tie
* The game ends after five rounds
* The player with the higher score wins

## Learning Objectives

This project demonstrates:

* Transitioning from console-based logic to a UI-based application
* Handling user interactions using event listeners
* Updating the DOM dynamically
* Writing clean, maintainable JavaScript code

---

## Possible Enhancements

The following improvements were intentionally excluded to keep the project focused:

* Restart button
* Animations or sound effects
* Input validation
* Persistent score storage

These features may be added later as practice or portfolio enhancements.
